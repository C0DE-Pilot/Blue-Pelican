Helpful Resources:

The codes and projects come from the Blue Pelican book, which you can buy or borrow from your school library.

I mainly use the software BlueJ for coding. It's free to download! Here's the link to BlueJ.

I can't post the book for obvious reasons, but you can purchase it from the official Blue Pelican Java website. Personally, I recommend buying it on Amazon.

About Me and the Code:

All codes are written by me and should be correct.

If you spot any mistakes, please let me know.

These codes aren't meant to be copied exactly but can be used as a reference or help.

I'm new to this, so I appreciate your help and feedback.

I'll frequently update this as I learn new things, so enjoy!

Remember, I'm not a professional coderâ€”I'm just sharing what I'm being taught. So, please don't expect the greatest from me.

Nonetheless, have fun exploring and playing around with the code.

I'll try to post more links and helpful resources frequently.
